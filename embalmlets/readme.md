## Huh?
This subrepo contains a bunch of utilities that go along with BURST in some way or another. 

To compile, follow this example with a newer version of gcc (7 works, 6 likely works):

gcc -m64 -O3 -march=sandybridge -fopenmp -o t2gg t2gg.c

Note: gcc-7 can be installed using conda: [https://anaconda.org/creditx/gcc-7] (https://anaconda.org/creditx/gcc-7)
